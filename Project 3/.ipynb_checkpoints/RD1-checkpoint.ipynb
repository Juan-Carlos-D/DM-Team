    "## **1. Problem Description (Business Understanding)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has revealed stark disparities in how counties across the United States—and particularly in Texas—have been impacted. Research has consistently shown that differences in health outcomes are influenced by a complex interaction of socioeconomic, demographic, and behavioral factors (CDC, 2021; Benitez et al., 2020). State and local health departments, including the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS), require reliable models to anticipate where resources and interventions are most needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to build predictive models that can accurately identify counties with high COVID-19 mortality rates using a range of population and health-related features. These include income inequality, poverty rates, commuting patterns, ability to work remotely, food insecurity, and access to healthcare (Raifman & Raifman, 2020). By understanding which variables most strongly correlate with severe outcomes, policymakers can prioritize data-driven strategies for prevention and resource allocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key stakeholders include:\n",
    "- **Public health agencies** (e.g., DSHS, CDC)\n",
    "- **Local governments** seeking to allocate medical supplies, testing, or vaccination campaigns\n",
    "- **Epidemiologists and data analysts** responsible for surveillance and predictive monitoring\n",
    "\n",
    "**Research Questions:**\n",
    "1. Which counties in Texas are most vulnerable to COVID-19 mortality based on social and economic indicators?\n",
    "2. Can predictive models classify counties as low, medium, or high risk with high accuracy?\n",
    "3. What are the most important features that drive model predictions, and how can they guide policy interventions?\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is important because it translates raw COVID-19 case data into actionable intelligence. A well-performing model will not only help in short-term response planning but also inform longer-term policy decisions to reduce structural vulnerabilities before future public health emergencies (Bertsimas et al., 2020).\n",

    "To predict county-level vulnerability to a future virus similar to COVID-19, we defined three classes based on historical COVID-19 death rates per 100,000 people. This outcome reflects the severity of pandemic impact, which public health departments use to allocate resources and prioritize interventions.\n",

    "\n",
    "These thresholds align with natural breakpoints in the observed distribution of the data (see histogram in Figure 1).\n",
    "They offer clear, interpretable groupings useful for health policy decision-making.\n",
